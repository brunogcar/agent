## 📝 Version History

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Pre-v1 | 2026-07-04 | Initial implementation. AST-based dependency extraction, SQLite graph storage, test targeting, project isolation. |
| **v1.1** | 2026-07-17 | **+11 languages + embedding performance.** (1) `LANGUAGE_MAP` expanded: Java, C, C++, Ruby, Lua, PHP, Scala, Swift, Kotlin. (2) `is_embedding_available()` — cached early-return check in `embeddings.py`. If LM Studio is down, all `embed_texts()` calls return None immediately (was: 965 × 30s timeouts). (3) Batched embedding in `parse_and_store.py` — 2-phase: parse → batch embed (100 per HTTP call). |
| **v1.0** | 2026-07-17 | **GraphStore.close_all() + atexit + AST cache key fix + roadmap cleanup.** (1) `GraphStore.close_all()` classmethod — closes ALL singleton instances + checkpoints WAL. Registered via `atexit` in `server.py` (was: no shutdown cleanup → potential WAL data loss on crash). (2) AST cache key fix — `parse_file_dependencies()` now uses the ORIGINAL `file_path` (may be relative) as the cache key, not the resolved absolute path. Cache hits survive project moves. (3) Roadmap cleanup — "Incremental indexing" marked ✅ Completed (already works via mtime+hash check in `discover_files.py`); "Fix yaml import" marked ✅ Completed (yaml IS available, was a false report). (4) understand v1.3.1: path resolve fix + ChromaDB path isolation (separate commits). |
| v1.3 update | 2026-07-13 | `tree_sitter_parser.py`: Added `DOC_EXTENSIONS` (.md/.txt/.rst), `ALL_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`, `is_doc_file()`. `embeddings.py`: Added `extract_doc_chunks()` — chonkie sentence chunking for prose files. Doc chunks have `type: "doc"` metadata. Soft dependency on chonkie (fallback to single chunk). |

## 🔄 In Progress / Next Up

| Feature | Notes | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Class/function-level nodes | Beyond file-level granularity | P2 |
| Cross-language support | JavaScript, TypeScript AST parsing | P3 |
| Call graph analysis | Function-level dependency tracking | P2 |
| Incremental indexing | ✅ v1.0 — Already works (mtime + file_size + content_hash check in `discover_files.py`) | — |
| Visualization | Mermaid/SVG export of dependency graphs | P3 |
| Test coverage integration | Map coverage data to graph nodes | P3 |
| Fix `yaml` import in `test_mapper.py` | ✅ v1.0 — Not a bug (yaml IS available; PyYAML is in requirements.txt). The real issue was `tree_sitter_languages` not installed. | — |
| GraphStore cleanup on shutdown | ✅ v1.0 — `close_all()` classmethod + `atexit` registration in `server.py` | — |
| Relative path in AST cache key | ✅ v1.0 — `parse_file_dependencies()` uses original `file_path` (not resolved) as cache key | — |
