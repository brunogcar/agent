# 🛡️ AI Instructions

## ❌ NEVER DO

1. **Never use `socket.getaddrinfo(timeout=...)`** — It has no `timeout` kwarg. Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` + `future.result(timeout=)`.
2. **Never pass an already-created coroutine to `retry_async_factory()`** — Factory must return fresh coroutine each call.
3. **Never use `threading.Lock()` for nested calls** — Use `threading.RLock()` to prevent deadlock.
4. **Never forget to reset the budget tracker between tests** — `_budget_tracker._calls.clear()` + `_configs.clear()`.
5. **Never hardcode retry/backoff math** — Use `get_retry_delay()` from `core.net.errors`.
6. **Never duplicate SSRF logic** — Use `_assert_safe_urls()` from `core.net.security`.
7. **Never forget to register SDK exceptions** — Call `register_retryable_exception()` for new SDK wrappers.
8. **Never skip `check_budget()` before paid API calls** — Prevents quota overruns.
9. **Never skip `record_tool_call()` after paid API success** — Budget tracking requires it.
10. **Never use `2001:db8::1` as a public IPv6 test address** — It\'s reserved in Python\'s `ipaddress` module. Use `2001:4860:4860::8888` instead.
11. **Never call `on_failure()` before `is_retryable()`** — Non-retryable errors must NOT trip the circuit breaker. `retry_async_factory` handles this correctly; don\'t bypass it.
12. **Never forget `ip.is_unspecified` in IP checks** — `0.0.0.0` and `::` are NOT caught by `is_private`/`is_loopback`/`is_reserved`/`is_multicast`.
13. **Never patch `core.net.retry.time.sleep` in tests** — `time` is a singleton module, so the patch is GLOBAL. Any background thread (browser reaper `time.sleep(60)`, watchdog) calling `time.sleep` during the test hits the mock, causing `assert_called_once()` to fail with thousands of stray calls. Patch `core.net.retry._sleep` instead (v1.6 module-level reference, scoped to `retry.py` only).

## ✅ ALWAYS DO

14. **Always import from `core.net` package** — `from core.net import ...` not `core.security` or `core.web_errors`.
15. **Always use `normalize_url()` for cache keys** — Deterministic, sortable, consistent.
16. **Always patch `allowed_internal_hosts` to empty in security tests** — Prevents environment config from interfering.
17. **Always reset circuit breakers between tests** — `_MY_CB.reset()` must be in a known state.
18. **Always use `AsyncMock` for async client methods in tests** — `_run_async_with_resilience` calls `asyncio.run(coro)`.
19. **Always include `error_code` in `fail()` calls** — Every error response must be programmatically consumable.
20. **Always check `can_execute()` before CB-protected operations** — Fail fast when circuit is open.
21. **Always fall through to HALF_OPEN check after OPEN→HALF_OPEN transition** — Don\'t return True immediately (v1.3 fix).
22. **Always verify `www.` strip boundary** — `www2.example.com` must NOT become `2.example.com`. Use `startswith("www.") and count(".") >= 2`.
23. **Always patch `core.net.retry._sleep` in retry tests** — The v1.6 module-level reference. Use `with patch("core.net.retry._sleep") as mock_sleep:` to mock the retry backoff sleep without affecting `time.sleep` globally.
22. **Always use raw strings for `</` → `<\/` replacement** — `.replace("</", r"<\/")` avoids invalid escape sequence SyntaxError under `-W error`.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns & Lessons Learned

> - **What happened:** `on_failure()` was called per retry attempt inside the loop, so a call that needed 2 retries to succeed would record 2 CB failures permanently. Three successful-but-retried calls would open the circuit breaker despite every call succeeding.
> - **Why it matters:** `record_success()` is a no-op in CLOSED CB state by design, so interim failures never cancelled out. The CB appeared to "randomly" open under flaky network conditions.
> - **Fix:** Move `on_failure()` out of the per-attempt loop — fire it only on final raise (retry exhaustion). Preserves v1.4 semantics: non-retryable errors still don't trip the CB.

> - **What happened:** `on_failure()` fired on ALL exceptions, including `ValueError` (validation) and 4xx client errors. The CB would trip on bad input, not just network failures.
> - **Why it matters:** A user passing an invalid URL could open the CB and block all subsequent valid calls for 60 seconds.
> - **Fix:** Guard `on_failure()` with `is_retryable(e)` — only retryable errors (timeouts, connection errors, 5xx) trip the CB.
